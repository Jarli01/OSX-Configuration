# OSX-Configuration
Installs Brew from Brew.sh and installs a set of tools and software configuration changes to help automate the setup of new OSX devices

To install I've been running with this saved locally on the system, and opening a su terminal and running ```sh brew-install.sh```

Uses casks to install bulk of the software, which is required for my user base. Once installed this way the primary applications can then be updated
with a simple ```brew update```.
